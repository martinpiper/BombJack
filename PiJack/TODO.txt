* Read data from the C64 user port
	Works from C64 BASIC, but C64 assembly tends to cause the Pi to miss a lot of data because it takes so long to read the GPIO...
	Although the 1MHz _PC2 is detected...
	* Even doing a tight poll in a thread doesn't help much
	* Seems even cachingthe value and using that in release mode isn't very performant *sigh*
	* TODO: Try??: https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/usage/gpio/



* When data is able to be read from the C64 reliably, then start to render graphics and use decoded memory writes to change the emulated rendering
