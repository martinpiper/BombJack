WiringPi (Unofficial Mirror/Fork)
=================================

This is an unofficial mirror/fork of wiringPi to support ports (Python/Ruby/etc).  With the
[end of official development](http://wiringpi.com/wiringpi-deprecated/), this repository
has become a mirror of the last "official" source release, plus a fork facilitating updates
to support newer hardware (primarily for use by the ports) and fix bugs.

  * The final "official" source release can be found at the
    [`final_source_2.50`](https://github.com/WiringPi/WiringPi/tree/final_official_2.50) tag.
  * The default `master` branch contains code that has been written since that final source
    release to provide support for newer hardware.
