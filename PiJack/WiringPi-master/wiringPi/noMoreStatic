wiringPi is no-longer shipped with the ability to statically link it.

Many reasons but the biggest issue is people who have statically linked
wiringPi into their product - for example a Pi UPS device or a Tetris-like
game and not subsequently shipped their modified sources. These people are
no better than common thieves with complete disregard to the conditions
of the LGPL that wiringPi ships with.

Additionally, many think it's a good idea to statically link wiringPi
into their favourite language - like Node, and Java and other itsy bitsy
little things. These people have a complete and utter disregard to what
happens underneath when e.g. the Linux kernel changes on the Pi then
wiringPi stops as it depends on some Pi kernel features, then the poor
user get in-touch with me and I've had over 10,000 emails so-far and
it's now beyond a joke.

DO NOT STATICALLY LINK WIRINGPI.
