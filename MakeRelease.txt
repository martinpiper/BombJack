	Using design explorer check all components are assigned to their appropriate layers
	Full place on all boards together
		Then auto-route
		Check connectivity
			Menu->Output->Generate IPC-D-356 Netlist
			Menu->Output->Pre-production check
				Connectivity
				Net zone routing
			Run
			Select all->Copy->Save text to file
			Then run CheckConnectivity with a command line like: "C:\work\BombJack\V8.0\Bomb Jack - All - Routed.IPC" "C:\work\BombJack\V8.0\connectivity check.txt" "C:\Work\BombJack\HeaderNets.txt"
	Ensure ICs, except EPROMs, are present in the BOM. Do not want to populate a bunch of sockets by accident.
	For BOMs: Ensure CLK and EPROM ICs, 27C512, use the socket in the BOM, not the IC.
	Ensure all components have ordering links



** Proteus Placement Grid default is 50th. Changing to 0.2in is much faster to auto place. But results is slightly less IC packing.

** For each board, ensure the signal layers have a GND power plane created
	Menu->Technology->Set Layer Stackup
* When trying to auto-route, gradually reduce the plane to signal layers until route succeeds
	Menu->Technology->Set Layer Stackup
		Gradually reduce each type "Plane" to "Signal" starting with the top most plane *with the greater number of existing layers* first.
		** Remember to check the Menu->Technology-Design Rule Manager
			Tab: Net Classes
				That Net Class: "Signal" is enabled for the required layers, adjust for layer pairs
* For boards with analogue signals, check those areas do not contain digital signals
	Using Track Mode highlights the tracks well
	Highlight 6MHz on the layout to easily check

				The "Supplier" column has IC sockets, for assembly where the actual ICs from the "Stock Code" column can be socketed.
				However most designs now have ICs soldered with decoupling capacitors and directly use the "Stock Code" column.
				For example:
					Sort by "Supplier"
						Then copy from "Supplier" into "Stock Code" any sockets PCBWay can order and assemble.
						** Use sockets for: **

			** Remove oscillators (VIDCLK, AUDCLK, *CLK etc.), prefer clock crystals, but keep their headers/sockets
			** EPROMs as sockets, not ICs
			** Check EPROMs with their sockets are not too close to ICs, especially the ends of the ICs hitting the EPROM pins

	Order note:
		Your standard stackup is OK.

	Assembly note:
		Please assemble 1 board, leave the other boards bare. The BOM file "Stock Code" column contains the component ordering links.
		This is my preferred supplier. Substitutions can be suggested if the supplier is out of stock and similar components can be sourced from your preferred supplier.

		There are decoupling capacitors (K104K15X7RF53H5 in the BOM) for each component marked with DC on the silk screen. One capacitor for DIP ICs marked with extra DC near pin 1, every component in the BOM "PCB Package" column with suffix CAP20

		There are decoupling capacitors (CL05B104KO5NNNC in the BOM) for each component marked with SDC on the silk screen. One capacitor for SMT ICs marked with extra SDC near pin 1, every component in the BOM "PCB Package" column with suffix -CAP
