* Release check list!
	Using design explorer check all components are assigned to their appropriate layers
	Full place on all boards together
		Then auto-route
		Check connectivity

			Menu->Output->Pre-production check
				Connectivity
				Net zone routing
			Run
			Select all->Copy->Save text to file
			Then run CheckConnectivity with a command line like: "C:\work\BombJack\V8.0\Bomb Jack - All - Routed.IPC" "C:\work\BombJack\V8.0\connectivity check.txt" "C:\Work\BombJack\HeaderNets.txt"
	Ensure ICs, except EPROMs, are present in the BOM. Do not want to populate a bunch of sockets by accident.
	For BOMs: Ensure EPROM ICs, 27C512, use the socket in the BOM, not the IC.
	Ensure all components have ordering links


	
** For each board, ensure the signal layers have a GND power plane created
	Menu->Technology->Set Layer Stackup
** Ensure the pad to pad distance is set to avoid soldering bridges, by moving via placement away from pads
	Menu->Design Rules Manager
	Design Rules tab->Rule Name = DEFAULT
		Pad-Pad = 35th (This is different to the default 10th)
* When trying to auto-route, gradually reduce the plane to signal layers until route succeeds
	Menu->Technology->Set Layer Stackup
		Gradually reduce each type "Plane" to "Signal" starting with the top most plane *with the greater number of existing layers* first.
		** Remember to check the Menu->Technology-Design Rule Manager
			Tab: Net Classes
				That Net Class: "Signal" is enabled for the required layers, adjust for layer pairs
* For boards with analogue signals, check those areas do not contain digital signals
	Using Track Mode highlights the tracks well
	Highlight 6MHz on the layout to easily check
* For PCBWay export and quote
	Menu->Output->Generate Gerber
		Choose: RS274X
	Menu->Output->Generate Pick and Place File
		Drop downs: Part ID | <<empty>> | Package | <<empty>> | Layer | Rotation | X | Y
		File format: CSV
		Export, append " - PNP" suffix

			Value
			Stock Code

		Text Import window
			Click top left grid, to select all cells
			Drop down: Column type: Text

			Menu->Data->Auto filter
			Group Layer
				Choose "Group Layer" filter (e.g. Chars)
				Choose "Placed" filter "Top Copper"
			Ctrl+A - Select all
			Ctrl+C - Copy
			Ctrl+N - New sheet
			Ctrl+V - Paste
			Menu->Data-Auto Filter
			Ctrl+A then double click column separator to resize all columns to fit the data
			For PCBWay BOM choose to merge suitable component sockets and any other intended components
				The "Supplier" column has IC sockets, for assembly where the actual ICs from the "Stock Code" column can be socketed.
				However most designs now have ICs soldered with decoupling capacitors and directly use the "Stock Code" column.
				For example:
					Sort by "Supplier"
						Then copy from "Supplier" into "Stock Code" any sockets PCBWay can order and assemble.
						** Use sockets for: **
							27C512 - EPROM
				Delete columns:
					Supplier
					Unit Cost
					Group Layer
				Save as XLSX file using " - BOM" suffix, where the naming matches the exported layer Gerber CADCAM file
					e.g. Bomb Jack - Video - Routed - CADCAM - BOM.xlsx
				Count ICs from "PCB Package" "*CAP20" then add a row similar to:
					Capacitors	59	One capacitor for ICs marked with extra DC near pin 1	K104K15X7RF53H5	https://www.mouser.sg/ProductDetail/Vishay-BC-Components/K104K15X7RF53H5?qs=sYfpZ29HcUSlgH5bSUHkYw%3D%3D	Decoupling capacitors for each DC component	All with suffix CAP20	Top Copper


			** Remove oscillators (VIDCLK, AUDCLK, *CLK etc.), prefer clock crystals
			** EPROMs as sockets, not ICs
			** Check EPROMs with their sockets are not too close to ICs, especially the ends of the ICs hitting the EPROM pins

				
	Order note:
		Your standard 1.6mm +/- 10% 1oz stackup is OK.
	Assembly note:
		Please assemble 1 board, leave the other boards bare. The BOM file "Stock Code" column contains the component ordering links.
		This is my preferred supplier. Substitutions can be suggested if the supplier is out of stock and similar components can be sourced from your preferred supplier.
		There are decoupling capacitors (K104K15X7RF53H5 in the BOM) for each component marked with DC on the silk screen. One capacitor for ICs marked with extra DC near pin 1
