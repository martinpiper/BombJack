* Check list!
	Using design explorer check all components are assigned to their appropriate layers
	Full place on all boards together
		Then auto-route
		Check connectivity
			Menu->Output->Generate IPC-D-356 Netlist
			Menu->Output->Pre-production check
				Connectivity
				Net zone routing
			Run
			Selact all->Copy->Save text to file
			Then run CheckConnectivity with a command line like: "C:\work\BombJack\V8.0\Bomb Jack - All - Routed.IPC" "C:\work\BombJack\V8.0\connectivity check.txt" "C:\Work\BombJack\HeaderNets.txt"
	Ensure ICs, except EPROMs, are present in the BOM. Do not want to populate a bunch of sockets by accident.
	Ensure EPROM ICs, 27C512, use the socket in the BOM, not the IC.
	Ensure all components have ordering links


	

* When trying to auto-route, gradually reduce the plane to signal layers until route succeeds
	Menu->Technology->Set Layer Stackup
		Gradually reduce each type "Plane" to "Signal" starting with the top most plane *with the greater number of existing layers* first.
		** Remember to check the Menu->Technology-Design Rule Manager
			Tab: Net Classes
				That Net Class: "Signal" is enabled for the required layers, adjust for layer pairs
* For PCBWay export and quote
	Menu->Output->Generate Gerber
		Choose: RS274X
	Menu->Output->Generate Pick and Place File
		Drop downs: Part ID | <<empty>> | Package | <<empty>> | Layer | Rotation | X | Y
		File format: CSV
		Export, append "- PNP" suffix
	Toolbar->Bill of Materials ($ icon)
		Use columns
			Stock Code
			Supplier
			Placed
		Choose: Full CSV
		Press CSV button ("a" document icon)
		Text Import window
			Click top left grid, to select all cells
			Drop down: Column type: Text
			Press: OK
			Menu->Data->Auto filter
			Group Layer
				Choose "Group Layer" filter (e.g. Chars)
				Choose "Placed" filter "Top Copper"
			Ctrl+A - Select all
			Ctrl+C - Copy
			Ctrl+N - New sheet
			Ctrl+V - Paste
			Menu->Data-Auto Filter
			Ctrl+A then double click column separator to resize all columns to fit the data
			For PCBWay BOM choose to merge suitable component sockets and any other intended components
				The "Supplier" column has IC sockets, for assembly. The actual ICs from the "Stock Code" column are then socketed.
				For example:
					Sort by "Supplier"
						Then copy from "Stock Code" into the empty supplied cells all those components PCBWay can order and assemble.
				Delete columns:
					Category
					Value
					Stock Code
					Unit Cost
					Description
					Group Layer
					PCB Package
				Save as XLSX file using "- BOM" suffix, where the naming matches the exported layer Gerber CADCAM file
	Order note: Your standard 1.6mm +/- 10% 1oz stackup is OK. Please assemble 1 board, leave the other boards bare. The BOM file "Supplier" column contains the component ordering links.
