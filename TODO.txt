* For the video combination layer, for each pixel input, perhaps add a pixel XOR value that can be used to introduce fast changing palette effects?
	This would be very useful for road layer palette cycling effects: 		http://www.extentofthejam.com/pseudo/#hw
	Or an alternative would be to have the tiles layer have two roads of course. Perhaps a copy of the first road but with differ palette for the second.

* APU needs VIDCLK counter/divider with jumper output select, first choice being raw VIDCLK, going to U35:D



* APU. Consider a game with double buffered screens, as is fairly common.
	Need a way for the APU to jump back to a PC and render the screen again using the current screen, or progress onto the second screen.
	* Perhaps have a new instruction kAPU_PCLoad16 which loads from reg0+1
		Also have a kAPU_SkipIfEQ which skips the instruction, by zeroing the instruction latches, if the current IDATA0 (IDATA bit 0) is zero
			It will be a good idea to have a stabilise instruction to make the chosen IDATA stable before using IfEQ
		This would allow the game code to have a memory location as a flag.
			Data registers could also be used if they are selected into IDATA, however since they are mostly used by non-trivial code then the extra complexity of allowing the user to independently reset them has little return.

		




* For board EA/EBS/EXTSEL config - Need to use jumpers (in the schematic it is closed to use the defaults) to connect the external bus to the internally used signals
	The routing will then not automatically connect the gap
	Jumpers should be placed on the edge of the board away from the interconnects

* For the mode7 register latches, it might be better to only latch on the HH byte write, but this would use an additional 3*6 latches, which would be too much.
	This would allow updates at any point in the scanline, with the copper. At the moment a write to the l/h/hh registers cannot happen in one pixel clock so the added value will be partially updated and used.



* Idea for new layer, scaled rotated sprites
	Setup sprite data x/y/dx/dxy/dy/dyx like mode7, plus a screen top left x/y plus width/height bounding box to iterate.
	It spits out pixels into the screen buffer and signals when it's done
		* This signal would need the ability to read values over the user port interface
	And could optionally hop into the next item in a link list... and signal the end of the link list
		the mode7 render got me thinking, because the circuitry only really differs in the "fetch a tile index from the screen memory" side of things
		So basically rendering a rotated quad outside the edges test becomes "is the X and Y tile position = 0" instead of "fetch tile index"
		If it's outside the edges then don't plot pixels
	* Could have one pixel push pipeline, that ends up writing to two RAMs, where the address is selected as the screen display (in read mode) or the write address from the calculation (in write mode)
		So 2 input 1 output selectors for the address.
