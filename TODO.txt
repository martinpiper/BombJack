* Instead of having 4 pixel headers in the video board, have one pixel input header. Then every board can have an input pixel and output pixel header instead.
	Each board can then do its own transparent pixel test and choose to pass-through the pixel or replace the pixel to its output pixel header
		The mode7 board can do an 8-bit pixel is transparent test, the other layers can use their 3-bit pixel test logic
	This would allow many more combinations of boards to be created and reduce the video board size.

* Programmable Macro Logic Device PMLD
	The end result would be to accelerate 3D polygon drawing, for example.
	A generic board with several external and internal RAMs, counters, and 8 bit registers.
	Some internal RAMs could be used as programmable ALU lookup tables etc
	Runs microcode than can trigger various latches and RAMs
	This could be an extension of the planned copper processor as it could in theory wait for horizontal and vertical pixel positions
		Then assert various values on the external memory bus, or its pixel output header
		The user port interface would need a "disable output" feature, make it tri-state
			Or this board could act as a memory/data pass-through board, where the user port memory interface is input and there is an output for the memory bus data.
				If the microcode had a default of memory pass-through mode, then during the visible portion of the screen it could take over the memory bus
				This would allow the C64 to control writes to the memory bus during the VBLANK and then the board can optionally takeover the memory bus when it needs
			Asserting the PMLD board EBS (to write its RAMs) will halt (not reset) the microcode PC clocking and processing
			It would need to pass back the VBLANK signal




* USB logic analyser and data generator: https://www.linkinstruments.com/logana32.html




* The "Sprite scan RAM logic" reads scan RAM, tests for transparency, writes sprite pixels in transparent or writes back existing value
	Perhaps change the logic so that the input sprite pixel is tested for transparency and only written if opaque?
		This would reduce the constant read, test, write back cycle to only test and optional write
		* This would mean the last sprite has priority instead of the first sprite however, i.e. the priority of sprites is reversed




* Consider higher current output than a normal 7805 regulator.

** V3.0 needs to be regenerated
	Connectivity check passes
	These ICs were auto-placed, then horizontally and vertically gaps were added and added to the board. This promoted better auto-placement for other ICs and helped auto-routing.
		U136
		U71
		U207
		U215
		U229
		U224
	Added feature request: https://support.labcenter.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=7821
	Note: Auto-route seems much easier when one board/group is auto-placed and routed instead of placing all the boards, then routing separately.
		Why? could be that when auto-placing all boards the layout is not as optimal.
			Comparing the force vectors between the "all board" and "single board" place shows major differences.
				Some components are pointing off board, when they should all be self contained to the group. This affects the placement.
	Note: Each board needs to be saved individually, with the other boards removed. Then place ICs by group: In PCB, components mode, use the drop-down filter, right click first component in list -> menu, "Place Group By Room"
		Then route each separate board



* Clock/video lines may need some buffering / extension with 74ls240 or similar for some of the larger boards due to the LS limit of 10 fan-out
	Design Explorer
	Main menu->View->Netlist view
		Then move up/down the netlist entries for each root sheet checking the size
		Sort the netlist table view by "Type" and monitor the number of inputs
	Potential problems:
		6MHz
		_MEWR
		EA*
		ED*




* https://www.mythtv.org/wiki/RGB_Scart
	Generating CSYNC from HSYNC+VSYNC
	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Component_video_sync




* Video - Changing from 12.096MHz to 15MHz to enable a 320 pixel (480 scan) wide display
	output\12.096M compared to output\15M shows sprite colour issues with 15M.
		Similar was seen when attempting hires mode Done.txt: "There is a strange sprite colour corruption when running at VIDCLK = 24 MHz"
	* Perhaps this is due to ripple from the pixel counters?
		* Try adding a latch for the counter outputs
			No improvement


	

* For the mode7 register latches, it might be better to only latch on the HH byte write, but this would use an additional 3*6 latches, which would be too much.
	This would allow updates at any point in the scanline, with the copper. At the moment a write to the l/h/hh registers cannot happen in one pixel clock so the added value will be partially updated and used.



* Perhaps a layer combination board, which does the zero 3-bit or 8 bit pixel test and allows multiple expansion planes to be used?



* Idea for new layer, scaled rotated sprites
	Setup sprite data x/y/dx/dxy/dy/dyx like mode7, plus a screen top left x/y plus width/height bounding box to iterate.
	It spits out pixels into the screen buffer and signals when it's done
		* This signal would need the ability to read values over the user port interface
	And could optionally hop into the next item in a link list... and signal the end of the link list
		the mode7 render got me thinking, because the circuitry only really differs in the "fetch a tile index from the screen memory" side of things
		So basically rendering a rotated quad outside the edges test becomes "is the X and Y tile position = 0" instead of "fetch tile index"
		If it's outside the edges then don't plot pixels
	* Could have one pixel push pipeline, that ends up writing to two RAMs, where the address is selected as the screen display (in read mode) or the write address from the calculation (in write mode)
		So 2 input 1 output selectors for the address.




* Need a simple bottom left |_ tile, then position this in the four corners with suitable H/V flips to allow the maximum pixel extent to be validated
	Then validate the border shrinks




* Investigate the "display enable" being used to still output video timings, just disable the pixel output
	This would allow memory updates to be enabled, without seeing bad video output and while maintaining video sync




* Auto-routing tests
	With default options, it takes ~15 minutes: https://support.labcenter.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=7693
	Are there quicker options?
		Yes, changing the grid does help but sometimes the boards are not populated fully as they run out of space.



* VSMDD2 why is "w$ff01ff00,$3f018000" triggering near raster 2f?
	* The copper (VSMDD2) RV[0..7] input needed an extra latching 74273 (U84 excluded from PCB) to smooth the signal from the counters
		This kind of buffering logic is going to be needed on the real hardware, and might need to be added to the VSMDD2 inputs from the CLK
* Below might be related...
* Colour bars: With the sin/cos wave pattern, it seems to clamp to a bad value? Investigate the data driving this pattern...
	The horizontal and vertical pixel counters might need to be latched



* GenerateData2
	* Is the slight pixel ripple effect observed when moving right (output\debug2.gif) is the hardware or the virtual display adaptor...
	* Much higher X resolutions (like 1024 pixels) on the virtual display need to be tested...
		* Higher resolutions do show the grass an other tiles with some very thin vertical colour edge bleeding on perhaps the tile boundary
			This might be due to the colour RAM fetch not being completely synced with the tile pixel shifting and output mix?
			Or this might be caused by the horizontal and vertical pixel clocks not being latched from the counters, so the counter ripple is not quite exactly settling all at the same time?





* Copper plans
	If the hires xpos is used, then consider starting a _MEWR pulse at that point in time and any further writes would be based on that time too.
	This would allow hires writes to the background colour for example.
	Any subsequent writes could then be lower resolution to fit with RAM timing constraints.
	Could the copper board be built in-between the 24 bit parallel board and the main display board?
		Input = EBS + EAB + EDB + ROWCOL, output = EBS + EAB + EDB
			Internally EBS = 2 is used to trigger the copper and ROWCOL checks
			It could use VIDCLK and 6MHz lines from ROWCOL
	Note: The selector and RAM are used to show working memory writes in the main display board
	* It would be possible to store a 16 bit addition value, to facilitate storage of screen data that is stored in values +16 bytes at a time



* Overscan, disable all pixel blanking from HBL?




* Need DigitalDisplay frame recording and verification of displayed frame with recorded frame.
	Pixel by pixel tests. Can display if the current frame as it is being built up matches the recording, or not.
	Highlight areas that don't match?
	
	

* Need the DigitalData model to also verify a recording against what it currently detects.
	It can also display if what it has received so far matches the recording.



* Need to update ReadMe to reflect new design



* Split design into layers, use common bus for internal communications
	* Renumber component refs depending on their layer, 1xx main, 2xx screen... etc.
	* Main: Clocking, video timing, pixel combination and palette lookups
	* Screen + colour RAM

* Reorganise the memory map detection logic, remove 3M:A for ROMs, 3M:B 4M 5M 2S:B 1C:A
	Add new memory block detection for _9800CS, _9A00CS, _9C00CS, _9E00CS
	Use a memory block that is not used by the expansion RAM, perhaps the BASIC ROM area
	Check the CPU memory expansion, BUSDDR or CPUHASBUS can also be used to improve the memory block chip detection
	


* For integration with the TTL 8 bit CPU the VSYNC signal could be exposed to EXPANSIONBUS:EXTWANTIRQ
	Remove extra unused logic E7P:A E7P:B E6P:C 5P:A
	This will need a latch arrangement similar to the CPU latch, no use holding EXTWANTIRQ low for so long without being acked
	CPU->Root sheet 8->U250:A
		CIA1 read ACK U201:A



* Allow the _HSYNC and _VSYNC to be read via the external header, as memory mapped IO. Probably reuse the number of sprite register see _9A00CS
	This would need _MERD to be added to the external header. Also the BUSDDR would need to be used to enable the correct tri-state output
* Allow RH AND RV to be accessed via memory mapped IO
	
	
	



* The expansion bus and the memory write signals will need to be translated to the internal memory write signals




	
* 4C/4D when run at 6MHz will generate "sub optimal write pulses" errors with default values. Running at 1MHz fixes these issues.
	* The output pixel data seems to be better when the timing is reduced.
	* Investigate the output for read/write timings of these memory ICs for 6MHz operation.

* All the very similar block, for the new RAMs and also the pixel shift outputs, could use a sub-circuit now
	Since they are RAM addressed and the ROM with its associated data file in the schematic is not important
	If the RAM/ROM names are still important, then have them outside of the sub-circuit



* Split this layout so that different output planes can be added or removed via internal headers, daisy-chained probably.
	The final combination logic can then take the output pixels and combine the final result via the pallet lookups
