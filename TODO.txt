* When using APU "And enable APU mode", the first Bus24Bit_Init will need an immediate APU_ResetDisable
	This is to ensure the APU is allowing RAM writes to the rest of the hardware




* APU: If there was a signal for "next instruction might need external bus" this could be used by the cached latched write proceed logic to stop a cached write before the real external write happens.
	In the current design we don't know if the *next* instruction will want the external bus, so we don't know when to time the cached write.
	Then the APU doesn't need to be paused while writing cached values, it only needs to write cached values when the current and next instructions do not have external/internal writes.
	This would need an extra signal however, which we currently don't have instruction RAM space for.




* Video: There is a desire to have an optional background colour from a defined palette entry if the final output pixel is transparent.
	This would make raster colour change effects much easier as only one palette entry would need to be changed instead of many for all possible rendered layers and their palette index values.
	Video control register: U264: 1 bit to enable or 0 to disable this functionality. When disabled the behaviour is as before.
	> Note: L5E2 would be a good choice to add most of the functionality as a hack daughter board.
		An alternative would be to have this functionality in the Combiner board (root sheet 14) which could use optionally the same address space as the video board, just uses the unused latch bits...
		From a final design flexibility point of view I don't want to have to force multiple pixel outputs through a new Combiner just to be able to access this functionality.
		It would be far better to use a daughter board into L5E2 and select the signal, perhaps the MIRRORED3 signal as it isn't being used.
		> There is also a spare signal on U262 pin 12 to allow the latch select for the final pixel colour? This would be after the layer enable flags at 0x9e0a, so 0x9e0b
		> It would be possible to unsolder U262 and L5E2 and use their current board positions to generate a plugin daughter board.
			Note: IC placements on current board: "C:\Work\BombJack\V8.0\Bomb Jack - Video - Routed.pdsprj"
		> Or just unsolder L5E2 and fly lead to U262 pin 12 would be less invasive.
		>> Hmm need access to DB[0..7], closest net to L5E2 is: U264 directly below L5E2
	> When enabled the lower 4 bits of the output pixel before it gets to L5E2 are compared for = 0
		Using a 2-to-1 demux with the enable bit and transparent bit, select either the pixel or the new latched transparent value

* User port: Expand this C64 user port breakout board to include the other data lines. Then I could add the ability to read RAM/registers from the video/audio expansion hardware.

		Empirically tested

		CIA pinout ( https://www.c64-wiki.com/wiki/CIA#Pinout ) shows pin 40 CNT is: CNT	Count - Internal timers can count pulses to this input. Can be used for frequency dependent operations.
	* Some design options... Using the new signals:
		** New 32 bit address space with option to use the old 24 bit board
			Large read/write external memory, with auto increment
			Still pass through _FLAG2 from 23 bit interface (video hardware) to the user port, also to the new internal 32 bit interface for any external processor
			Option to let external device control the output to the old 24 bit interface board, to write data to the video hardware
			Use case 1 : Read/write large amounts of memory from the C64 user port, with offset and auto increment for faster screen scrolling or lots of extra graphics or decompression of video/audio data
				Scrolling would be faster because only absolute loads/stores would be needed instead of load/stores with X/Y offsets
				Decompression would be faster as the source data pointer would not need to be updated. However an end data pointer might be needed... Or an end of decompressed data pointer test...
			Use case 2 : External processor calculates 3D data and then allows result memory to be read after it has completed calculation
				A simple latch register, without contention, indicating "job complete" at a certain address range would be suitable
			Use case 3 : External processor calculates and sends large amounts of data direct to the video hardware via the old 24 bit interface
			* SERIALATN = 0 : Keep the old 24 bit board, and have an interface that uses the old 14 pin header. Pass through PA2, D0..7, _PC from computer when active
				The 32 bit memory interface is bypassed by the user port, meaning the external processor can access the memory
				The external processor would need to wait if wanting to access the old 23 bit interface
			* SERIALATN = 1 : New 32 bit memory interface mode
				SP2 = 0 : External device controls the 24 bit and 32 bit interface
				SP2 = 1 : User port controls the 24 bit and 32 bit memory interface
					External devices would need to wait if they need to perform writes
					The transition time from SP2 = 1 to PA2 = 0 or _PC = 0 can be such that existing writes from an external device have time to complete
					PA2 : Low, reset all external address and data bus drivers, start reading 4 bytes for the address and then extra bytes on _PC for address increment
					SP1 = 0 : Read address, address bus drivers active but data bus drivers inactive, allowing read from external memory
					SP1 = 1 : Write address, address bus and data drivers active.

* With a read capable user port expansion, it should be possible to expand the simple CPU to be able to perform more complex ALU ops.
	This could enhance 3D calculation.
	Or scrolling...
	
	



			

* APU: To get more instruction options, it would be possible to use the control register to allow extra RAM addressing for the instruction and data RAMs.
	This would allow more data selection options, more registers, and more ALU options.

* Audio assembly issue: For U91---Part is 2*7 but board request 2*8
	It's a 7432
	Luckily only one gate used. First layer, for memory control.
	* Should be DIL14CAP20 but it's using a DIL16CAP20. Oops!
	** Use the package tool to update the custom part package
	** TODO: Check all 7432 on all other boards
	>> U91:C -> U71:C : So might be possible to use three flying leads to that spare gate on the build...
		Of course it's on opposite edges, bottom middle and top left. Arghh
	* 7, 8, 9, 10, 14 are the only pins used according to the layout

		"In many cases the datasheet for an IC will give a recommended value for the capacitor. If no value is suggested, 0.1uF (100nF) is widely accepted as a standard go-to value. For most designs, a standard ceramic 0402, 0603, or 0805 package size will typically work well as a bypass cap."

* Try recording a high resolution APU bus sample using the DG?



* Now the APU DG timing is fixed, perhaps revisit the _OE logic removal on all other video areas



* APU: Remove instruction RAM _OE logic




* APU: The instruction memory is not limited to 8KB, since it is mapped to $8000
	Using a better select it would be possible to widen the instructions to 64 bits
	This would allow more register selects, ALU operations, status register, indirected selects and branching options
	It would also allow 8 bits to be spent on immediate load values from the instruction



* Sprites2: If I double the RAMs used for storing scaled sprite registers, I can load 2x8 bits in parallel and draw more data.



* Hardware multiply?
	result = 0
	for(b = 0 to 31)
	{
		// Or use bit select, or value shift per iteration...
		if( ((y >> b) & 1) != 0)
		{
			// Use value shift per iteration...
			result = result + (x << b)
		}
	}
* Hardware edge trace?
	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bresenham%27s_line_algorithm#Algorithm_for_integer_arithmetic




* Audio - Check how many ICs/gates need to maintain state for each voice. Compare with remaining ICs/gates used for calculation and interface to the common address bus
	Estimate if there is saving to reduce the rest of the voice calculation to common functionality and state gates with selection logic



* Sprites3
	Choose scale table (allows the root2 or unscaled table to be chosen, useful if the corners of the rotated sprite are not that important) and ignore X/Y boundaries for tiling up to the sprite edge bit flags
	


* Check if constant _OE can be used on all 6116 and 6264 chips instead of toggling them
	Video board shows logic contentions, but data writes seem to still be OK




* Kobiconn plugs are obsolete and need replacing

	removed from V8.0 BOM


* Video: The analogue signals between the resistor ladders and their headers could benefit from being manually placed with wider gaps?
	Also the VGA and 2x4 header output could benefit from being closer to the resistor ladders?



* Audio: Perhaps widen the resistor ladders and separate the analogue output, much like the video board usage of keepout areas

* Sprites : Perhaps with the much faster option 15ns 64 kbit narrow (skinny) PDIP-28 (due to: "(6116SA20TDB) 2Kx8 SRAM 20ns is going end of life")
	* There is maybe an option for over clocking the sprite scanline calculation just like the scaled sprites2 layer does?
	* This would give the option of drawing many more normal sprites



	
* Sprites3
* Scaled sprite rotation, if the EPROM is too slow, then split the pixel output across two clocks?
	There would need to be some latches for the second part of the output path, to ensure that the next sprite being read (during the attribute read) does not affect the final values being written
		Or simpler to pass through the reset logic signal to the last part of the pixel output, which would increase the end period between one sprite and the next sprite reads by one clock as the pixels are flushed...
	2 x 64KB EPROMS, for X and Y rot, the high bit in one of the EPROMS would indicate if the result it out of the sprite bounds or not
	Possible to have different X/Y rotations? Which would generate some skews?
		Doesn't look good...
	https://segaretro.org/Sega_X_Board
		Sprite pixels/texels per frame: 833,333 (at 60 Hz) to 838,408 (at 59.6368 Hz)
		Sprite pixels/texels per scanline: 3180 to 3200 sprite pixels/texels per scanline
		Sprites/textures per scanline: 256

	https://github.com/bji/libmame/blob/master/old/src/mame/video/sega16sp.c#L1059
	Perhaps the sprite index high bit could signify sqrt(2) corrected scales to avoid sprite edges
		Meaning select different rotation EPROMs...
		Allowing the full 256 rotations to be used in the lookup
		Plus full 8 bits used for X/Y coords...
		Hmm X and Y would need to be used, or would need multiply lookups for separate X and Y with adds, which doubles IC count...
		Plus X/Y coordinate correction EPROMs based on rotation...





* The single cycle low pulse for "end of hblank" as well as "start of hblank" could be exposed via the backplane




* Sprites2: Try reducing the time needed to read the registers, by not having the memory rest periods before the latches
	Initial test didn't work so well, looks like the calculations and loads went wrong

* Consider a "hat" board for each voice, using a common bus interfacing with the main logic board
	Each hat would have a signal to select it from the voice schedule




* For the video combination layer, for each pixel input, perhaps add a pixel XOR value that can be used to introduce fast changing palette effects?
	This would be very useful for road layer palette cycling effects: 		http://www.extentofthejam.com/pseudo/#hw
	Or an alternative would be to have the tiles layer have two roads of course. Perhaps a copy of the first road but with different palette for the second.
	https://www.spriters-resource.com/arcade/outrun/




* User port layout : Consider moving the ribbon cable header to the bus edge

* User port: For the Raspberry Pi interface it is useful to have the 5V from the C64 drive the 5V side of the level shifters
	This would need an extra line for the C64 5V and call the net "C645V", be careful not to connect it to the 5V on the externally powered user port interface!

* USB logic analyser and data generator: https://www.linkinstruments.com/logana32.html

* For the mode7 register latches, it might be better to only latch on the HH byte write, but this would use an additional 3*6 latches, which would be too much.
	This would allow updates at any point in the scanline, with the copper. At the moment a write to the l/h/hh registers cannot happen in one pixel clock so the added value will be partially updated and used.



* Idea for new layer, scaled rotated sprites
	Setup sprite data x/y/dx/dxy/dy/dyx like mode7, plus a screen top left x/y plus width/height bounding box to iterate.
	It spits out pixels into the screen buffer and signals when it's done
		* This signal would need the ability to read values over the user port interface
	And could optionally hop into the next item in a link list... and signal the end of the link list
		the mode7 render got me thinking, because the circuitry only really differs in the "fetch a tile index from the screen memory" side of things
		So basically rendering a rotated quad outside the edges test becomes "is the X and Y tile position = 0" instead of "fetch tile index"
		If it's outside the edges then don't plot pixels
	* Could have one pixel push pipeline, that ends up writing to two RAMs, where the address is selected as the screen display (in read mode) or the write address from the calculation (in write mode)
		So 2 input 1 output selectors for the address.




* Need a simple bottom left |_ tile, then position this in the four corners with suitable H/V flips to allow the maximum pixel extent to be validated
	Then validate the border shrinks






* Need DigitalDisplay frame recording and verification of displayed frame with recorded frame.
	Pixel by pixel tests. Can display if the current frame as it is being built up matches the recording, or not.
	Highlight areas that don't match?
	
	

* Need the DigitalData model to also verify a recording against what it currently detects.
	It can also display if what it has received so far matches the recording.



* Need to update ReadMe to reflect new design




* Socket orientation on silkscreen



* It should be possible to record the real hardware user port interface data with the logic analyser and reconcile that with what is recorded in emulation. The logic analyser can export data as a CSV file.
	* Also then reconcile the APU output with emulated output.




* Maybe the output vertical black lines are due to the output pixel being clocked too quickly after the left hand HSYNC pulse timing? Perhaps delaying the output pixel clock will help reduce black lines?
	Or maybe the latch needs more decoupling capacitor support?
	Check the original schematic for output latching, check for any extra filtering?
