## 1.0

This number concerns the initial PIGFX version by Filippo Bergamasco. Although no software version is encoded in source files, 
this version has a version constant defined in `pigfx_config.h`, which is generated by `make` using the Git deposit version number.

A 3 numbers software version has been added in `pigfx_config.h.in`, which is generated in `pigfx_config.h`and displayed at boot.
