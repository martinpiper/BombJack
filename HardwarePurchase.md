Important considerations
========================

* Once the purchase is made *it cannot be cancelled or refunded once fabrication is requested* because you are buying a hand made one off bespoke solution
* It takes at least 30 days, after the money is received, for populated PCBs to be delivered
* Delivery of remaining components can also take 10 days, assuming there is stock
* Construction and testing can take 5 days
* Delivery can take 10 days
